# A JavaScript interpreter for the CSP Exam Reference language

A tiny interpreter for the langauge defined on the exam reference sheet for the Computer Science Principles AP test. Documentation for this language is available from CollegeBoard at [https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf] on page 121.

Usage:
```
./main.coffee example_program.cspp
```

This project has two aims:
  - to define a usable grammar for a Droplet mode for the CSP exam language
  - to make CSP exam language runnable, ideally with broad tracing and debugging capabilites, for CSP AP students.
